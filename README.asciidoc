POM Transformation plugin; provides facilities for transforming POMs using XSL.
Compared to the http://mojo.codehaus.org/xml-maven-plugin/[xml-maven-plugin]
this plugin offers a deeper integration with the domain of POM transformation
via a standard library of extension functions and stylesheets designed for
processing POMs.

The plugin is capable of processing both "raw" POM files, as well as serialised
versions of the model itself (allowing for transformation of the "effective"
POM). 

A maven generated project site is available for the latest
http://dthu.me/projects/xpom-maven-plugin/[snapshot] version.
