  <para>
    XPOM makes use of an internal namespace in order to implement part of the
    bridge between Java and XSL. The URI of this namespace is
    <code>urn:xpom:internal</code>. <emphasis>This namespace is internal only
    </emphasis>; it is subject to unannounced change between releases
    and should <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> be used directly in XPOM stylesheets.
    Every attempt is made to suppress it from output, but if you see it:
    ignore it :-).
