    XPOM provides access to all the POMs in the current reactor build via the
    <code>urn:xpom:reactor-projects</code> URI. The <code>base-uri</code> for
    each document is the filesystem location of its POM. This is particularly
    useful when combined with the <code>aggregate</code> parameter, which
    causes any of the XPOM goals to execute only once per build.
